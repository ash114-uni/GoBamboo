        Why Choose Bamboo
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Bamboo is a plant that is grown without the need of pesticides and fertilisers and grows at a rapid rate
        and is readily harvested every 3 to 5 years.

        Bamboo is also biodegradable and the production of its fibre
        is more environmentally friendly in contrast to synthetic fibres.
